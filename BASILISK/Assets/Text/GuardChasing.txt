You! Stop!
Stop at once!
Halt!!!
You're not supposed to be here!
Don't you play games with me!
It's dangerous out here!
You look lost...
Where are your parents, boy?
You're past your curfew!
Dear boy, I shall have to help you find your way!
I must lead the astray back to their rightful path.
No visitor pass, no visits!
Show me your papers!
You'd best behave now or I'll give you what for!
Why I oughta!
What the devil do you think you're doing!
I must say that this is most irregular!
