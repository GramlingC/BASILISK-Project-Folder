GUARD1: Just got news from the Institute 
GUARD1: about what that rebel light machine looks like. 
GUARD2: I didn't get any info on the thing...
GUARD1: Apparently this thing is a lamp affixed to a short pole.
GUARD1: To make it work, you gotta use a crank.
GUARD2: A crank? How primitive.
GUARD1: What do you expect from a bunch of cave people?
