GUARD1: Geoff, you remember those guys who passed through here a few days ago?
GUARD2: The ones who acquired that woman? Yeah.
GUARD1: You know what happened to her?
GUARD2: If we were important enough to know that, we wouldn’t be stuck out here guarding the tunnels.
GUARD1: Point. But, doesn’t it seem strange? What does the Board want with her?
GUARD2: She probably just crossed the Institute or something. I don’t know, man.
