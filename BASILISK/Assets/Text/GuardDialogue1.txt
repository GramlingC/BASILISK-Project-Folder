GUARD1: Geoff, you remember those guys who 
GUARD1: passed through here a few days ago?
GUARD2: The ones who acquired that woman? Yeah.
GUARD1: You know what happened to her?
GUARD2: If we were important enough to know that,
GUARD2: we wouldn’t be stuck out here
GUARD2: guarding the tunnels.
GUARD1: Point. But, doesn’t it seem strange?
GUARD1: What does the Board want with her?
GUARD2: She probably just crossed
GUARD2: the Institute or something.
GUARD2: I don’t know, man.
